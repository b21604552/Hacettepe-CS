Error Handling Notice:
  While working with function, I added some meaningfull message to functions
returns. There is some process manage for returning meaningfull message to
end users. Therefore there can be a point that you wait and error status,
but function gives success. If you look at the transaction logs field that
decoded output. There is a message that explain function run status.
